    <div class="heading2">Rules</div>
    <div class="text-content">To confirm the Uber Elder kill for the purpose of prize collection, a screenshot of the loot and verification of items must be posted on GGGs of<span></span>ficial forums.<br>
        To be eligible for the prize, a player may NEVER have two characters alive at the same time in the Actual Hardcore League.<br>
        Once a prize is collected, further prizes cannot be collected by Uber Elder kills of the same class or damaging skills (further detailed below).<br>
        No Muling.<br>
        Once a character has entered the Templar Laboratory they cannot re-enter this zone with the same character (further detailed below).<br>
        Accounts must be set to public for the duration, in order to be eligible for prizes.<br>
        You must have a paypal account to collect the prize.<br>
        The prize pool will be split evenly three ways for three prizes.<br>
        You will no longer be able to add to the prize pool once the first prize is collected.<br>
        A player cannot gain multiple prizes from multiple kills.<br>
        If no player collects the prize by the end of the private league, all contributions will be returned.<br>

    <div class="heading2">FAQ</div>
    <div class="faq-style">Why only one character alive allowed?</div>
    <div class="text-content">Even though there is no stash, using multiple characters muling is possible, this is an anti cheat measure. If you want to use multiple characters in the league feel free, you simply are not eligible for prizes.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">Why can a character not enter the Templar Laboratory?</div>
    <div class="text-content">The Templar Laboratory can be used to circumvent the “No Stash” rule when players reach maps. This is simply to maintain the challenge of “No Stash”.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">Is this even possible?</div>
    <div class="text-content">Maybe.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">What does damaging skills mean?</div>
    <div class="text-content">Skills (buffs or debuffs) that contribute to the dps of the build (directly, through totems, traps minions, etc). I cannot make an exact list as many skills can be used as both utility and damage. Keep in mind that this may include more than just the “primary ability” due to the nature of complexity in PoE.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">What does same class mean?</div>
    <div class="text-content">If for example a player completes Uber Elder with a Juggernaut, the class is Marauder. Juggernaut, Chieftain and Berserker are no longer able to collect a prize.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">What if no one wins?</div>
    <div class="text-content">All donations to the pool will be returned via the paypal return system and no prizes will be awarded.</div>
    <div class="faq-style">What if less than 3 people win?</div>
    <div class="text-content">If 1 or 2 people collect the prize, and there is a 3rd who completed Uber Elder but on a class or skill that was already eliminated, the remaining prizes will be awarded as such. If there are no available candidates then the remaining pool will be split between the winners (players who already collected a prize).</div>
    <div class="faq-style">Can I contribute to the prize pool?</div>
    <div class="text-content">Yes you can! Follow the link for more information: <a href="https://paypal.me/pools/c/8cz0ygBlH6" target="_blank">
